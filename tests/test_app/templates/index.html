<h1>django-multistep-select</h1>

<p>This is the test project for <strong>django-multistep-select</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>django-multistep-select</strong> aims to provide a flexible multistep selection form widget for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>'s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/">Forms API</a>. It can help with the arbitrary filtering of choices, as well as serve as a representation of a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#id1">GenericForeignKey</a> field.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you <strong>just want to use the widget</strong>, you don't really need this test project; just install the app into your own project, as described in the <kbd>INSTALL</kbd> file.</li>
    <li>If you would like to <strong>run the included unit tests</strong>, you would need to do this from the command line. Try <kbd>python manage.py test test_app</kbd></li>
    <li>Finally, the following <strong>demo pages</strong> are included to facilitate development:<br><a href="{% url 'simple' %}">simple object creation</a> (doesn't include the widget yet); <a href="{% url 'filter' %}">multistep_select as filter</a>; <a href="{% url 'generic' %}">multistep_select as generic</a>.</li>
</ul>
